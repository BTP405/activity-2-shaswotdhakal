# Approach 1
In this approach the function `double(n)` creates a list of numbers from `0` to `n-1` and each of them multiplied by 2 and the function returns the list. The ```for``` loop prints each of the element returned by ```doubleL(n)``` seperated by ```:```.

# Approach 2
In this approach it creates a list of numbers from 0 to 4 and each number is doubled then printed in the list. and a `:` is also being placed after each number.

# Approach 3
This method creates a special type of function called a generator function named `doubleG(n)`. This function gives number 0 to less than n and each number is doubled. After that it prints each number ig gets froom `doubleG(n)` and puts a `:` after each number.
